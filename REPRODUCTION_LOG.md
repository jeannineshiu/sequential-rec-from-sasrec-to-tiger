## Week 1 — Data pipeline, evaluators, baselines

**2026-07-23**

- **Data pipeline sanity check.** Ran `src/data/download.py` + `src/data/preprocess.py`
  (5-core filtering, leave-one-out split) on MovieLens-1M.
  - Result: `users=6040 items=3416 interactions=999611`, `avg sequence length=165.50
    (min=18, max=2277)`.
  - This matches Kang & McAuley (2018) Table 1 essentially exactly (paper: 6040 users,
    3416 items, avg actions/user 165.5). Strong signal the 5-core + reindexing logic is
    correct before any model code is written.
  - No-leakage assertions (`test[u] not in train[u]`, `valid[u] not in train[u]`) pass
    for all users.

- **Evaluator unit tests.** Built a 3-user hand-computed toy dataset for both the sampled
  (1 pos + 100 neg) and full-ranking evaluators (`tests/test_eval.py`). Both match manual
  HR@k / NDCG@k calculations exactly. Evaluator protocol is now frozen — no changes to
  `src/eval/metrics.py`, `sampled.py`, or `full_ranking.py` without re-running every
  affected experiment.

- **Fixed negative sampling.** Generated one `negatives.json` (seed=42, 100 negatives/user,
  excluding each user's train+valid+test items) so every model — self-implemented SASRec,
  RecBole SASRec/BERT4Rec, and the TIGER-style model — gets scored against the identical
  negative set. This is what makes the Week 4 cross-validation and Week 6 comparisons
  meaningful rather than apples-to-oranges.

- **Baselines (ML-1M, test set, k=10):**

  | Model | sampled HR@10 | sampled NDCG@10 | full HR@10 | full NDCG@10 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Popularity | 0.4363 | 0.2401 | 0.0369 | 0.0180 |
  | BPR-MF (implicit, factors=64, iters=100) | 0.5745 | 0.3357 | 0.0671 | 0.0333 |

  - BPR-MF clears Popularity on every metric, as expected — sanity check that the
    pipeline + evaluators aren't silently broken in a way that makes baselines
    indistinguishable.
  - The gap between sampled and full-ranking numbers (e.g. Popularity 0.44 vs 0.037
    HR@10) is the Krichene & Rendle (2020) sampled-metric inflation effect, visible
    even at the baseline stage. Worth a callout in the README methodology section.
  - Logged to MLflow (`sqlite:///mlflow.db`, experiment `sequential-rec`, runs
    `popularity_ml1m` / `bpr_mf_ml1m`).

- **Still open before Week 1 is fully closed:** run SASRec via RecBole (or the official
  repo) once to record a third-party reference number for Week 2's triangulation step.
